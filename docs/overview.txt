html5...
    - crappy internet
    - run mobile
        - html 5 (manifest)
            - appcache is a crappy
            - canvas
            - manan : webview -> "android webview, android webview -> wraps into and app"
    - javascript
        - requirejs
        - singlepage
            - knockout vs angular vs ember
    - nodejs
        - socket.io -> websockets

    - don't validations on the server (lightweight server)
        - fit all kind different turn based games
        - send messages
            - client side validations

    - open auth (google+, facebook)

    - room (smaller) "connection"
        - board (multiple) -> 2 players



    - board object
        - rules
        - rules prevent me to play in a wrong way
        - rules (the same at the other client)
            - blocks invalid moves


    - good_human -> [canvas -> board -> rules -> connection ] -> smart_server -> [ connection -> board -> rules' -> canvas ] -> bad_human
